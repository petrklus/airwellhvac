Airwell IR control reverse-engineering

This is to document my efforts to reverse-engineer codes to control Airwell HVAC air conditioning unit. 

The goal is to reverse-engineer the protocol the AC is using and to build a IR transmitter to transmit the signals. The arduino-based unit should also be capable of receiving IR signals to capture if the original remote is used to change state of the A/C unit.
